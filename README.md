Duration of Thrombocytopenia in Sepsis: A New Dimension in Prognostic Assessment

Thrombocytopenia (TP) in individuals with severe sepsis is linked to unfavorable outcomes. While previous research focused on TP severity, the impact of its duration on prognosis has been largely overlooked. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 1,730 critically ill sepsis patients (average TP duration: 3.2 days) and grouped them based on TP duration: no TP, transient TP (resolved in 1–3 days), and persistent TP (lasting >3 days). The in-hospital mortality risk was assessed using a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model and the Kaplan–Meier method. Our findings were validated using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database.  During a 28-day observation period, as persistent TP duration increased, there was a significant decline in nonventilator days and days spent in the intensive care unit and hospital (p<0.001). We also observed increased mortality (p<0.001) and transfusion rates (p<0.001). After confounder adjustment, transient TP was not significantly linked with in-hospital mortality, but persistent TP was. Differentiating between transient and persistent sepsis-associated TP based on a duration >3 days has clinical importance. While platelet counts are routinely monitored in sepsis patients, TP duration might provide additional prognostic value.
