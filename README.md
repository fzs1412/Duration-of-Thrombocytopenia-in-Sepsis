Duration of Thrombocytopenia in Sepsis: A New Dimension in Prognostic Assessment

Background: Thrombocytopenia (TP) in patients with sepsis is strongly associated with adverse outcomes. Previous research has predominantly focused on the severity of TP, while the prognostic impact of its duration remains insufficiently explored. This study aimed to investigate the association between the duration of sepsis-associated thrombocytopenia (SAT) and clinical outcomes.Methods: This retrospective multicenter study analyzed data from critically ill sepsis patients admitted to Dongyang People's Hospital, the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database, and the Chinese Multi-omics Advances In Sepsis 2.0 study. The median duration of TP in patients with SAT was approximately 3.2-3.5 days. Based on TP duration, patients were categorized into three groups: no TP, transient TP (resolution within 1-3 days), and persistent TP (duration >3 days). Multivariable logistic regression models, propensity score matching , and Kaplan-Meier methods were employed to assess the risk of in-hospital mortality.Results: Over a 28-day observation period, patients with persistent TP had significantly fewer ventilator-free days, ICU-free days, and hospital-free days (all p<0.001) compared to those with transient TP. Furthermore, persistent TP was associated with significantly higher mortality (p<0.001) and transfusion rates (p<0.001). After adjusting for confounders, multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that transient TP was not significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (p>0.05), whereas persistent TP remained an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality (p<0.05). propensity score matching analysis yielded consistent findings.Conclusion: Utilizing a 3-day cutoff to differentiate between transient and persistent SAT demonstrates significant clinical utility. While platelet count is a routine monitoring parameter in septic patients, the duration of TP offers additional, valuable prognostic information, potentially guiding risk stratification and therapeutic strategies.
